== Username

You can have the username set in the configuration as shown above, or you can have it read from an environment variable.
The configured name of the FTP server will be used to build the environment variable name.
This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_FTP_NAME_USERNAME`. If your instance is named `production`,
you can store the username in the environment variable `JRELEASER_FTP_PRODUCTION_USERNAME`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.

If a configured username is found in the configuration file, then the environment variable is not used at all.
