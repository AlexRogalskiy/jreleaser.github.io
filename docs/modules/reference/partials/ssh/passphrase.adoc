== Passphrase

The passphrase will be stored in an environment variable. The configured name of the {prefix} server will
be used. This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_PASSPHRASE`. If your instance is named `production`,
you need to store the secret in the environment variable `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PRODUCTION_PASSPHRASE`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.

Alternatives to `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_PASSPHRASE` are (in order):

* `JRELEASER_SSH_NAME_PASSPHRASE`
* `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PASSPHRASE`
* `JRELEASER_SSH_PASSPHRASE`
