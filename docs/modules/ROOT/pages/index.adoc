= JReleaser

JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

== What it Does

JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, binary distributions
(`.zip`, `.tar`), JLink images, or any other file that you'd like to publish as a Git release on popular Git services
such as Github. Distribution files can additionaly be published to be consumed by popular package managers as Homebrew,
Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via Jbang. Releases may be announced in a variaty of channels such as
Twitter, Zulip, or SDKMAN!

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.yml` file if using the xref:tools:cli.adoc[CLI] or
xref:tools:ant.adoc[ANT] options, or direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` (xref:tools:maven.adoc[Maven]) or
`build.gradle` (xref:tools:gradle.adoc[Gradle]) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command.

Every step of the release process is configurable. Inputs can be parameterized externally; several input files can be
provided as templates.
