= JReleaser

JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.yml` file if using the xref:tools:cli.adoc[CLI] or
xref:tools:ant.adoc[ANT] options, or direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` (xref:tools:maven.adoc[Maven]) or
`build.gradle` (xref:tools:gradle.adoc[Gradle]) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command.
