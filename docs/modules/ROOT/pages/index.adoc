= JReleaser

JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options. However, you may use it with projects that do
not require publishing binary assets. You may use it to create Git releases (tag, changelog, assets), announce releases,
create additional binaries and files to be published via package managers. JReleaser supports any kind of project regardless
of its source language (Java, Node, Rust, Perl, Python, C/C++, C#, Elixir, etc), although it provides additional benefits
to Java based projects.

== What it does

JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Apache Ant, Apache Maven, Gradle, Cargo, NPM, etc) such as JAR files, binary distributions
(`.zip`, `.tar`), JLink images, or any other file that you'd like to publish as a Git release on popular Git services
such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea. Distribution files can additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers
as Homebrew, Snapcraft, Scoop, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases may be announced in a variety of channels such
as Twitter, Zulip, Sdkman, and others. Have a look at the listed xref:integrations.adoc[integrations].

JReleaser provides explicit integration via plugins for {icon_ant_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[Apache Ant],
{icon_maven_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[Apache Maven], and {icon_gradle_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[Gradle] build tools.
Use the {icon_cli_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[CLI] for any other build tool.

Some examples of non-Java projects:

 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/cpp.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/csharp-cross-platform.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/elixir.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/rust-cross-platform.adoc[]

== How does it work

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.[yml|toml|json]` file if using the
{icon_cli_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[CLI] or {icon_ant_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[Apache Ant] options, or
direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` ({icon_maven_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[Apache Maven]) or
`build.gradle` ({icon_gradle_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[Gradle]) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command or any other commands described in the
xref:workflow.adoc[].

Every step of the release process is configurable. Inputs may be parameterized externally. Several input files may be
provided as templates.

== Where does it run

You can run JReleaser at your local development machine or at any of the supported
xref:continuous-integration:index.adoc[CI/CD] services.

== Acknowledgments

JReleaser is heavily inspired by link:https://goreleaser.com[GoReleaser]. It also builds on top of the lessons learned
from link:https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang[JBang]'s original build setup. Since July 2021 JBang's releases are now
posted via JReleaser.
