= Binary

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native binary, as a consequence you *must* specify a platform value
for each one of their artifacts.

Distributions of this type conform to the following file structure:

[source]
----
.
├── LICENSE
├── README
└── bin
    └── executable
----

== Creating a Distribution

You can use any tool/language at your disposal to create a distribution of this type as long as the file structure is
followed and the final artifact packaged as a Zip or Tar file. The archive must contain a root entry, typically
following the name of the archive, thus if the archive is named `app-1.2.3.zip` the root entry should be `app-1.2.3`.

Alternatively, you may also configure a xref:configuration:assemble/archive.adoc[] assembler to create an archive.
