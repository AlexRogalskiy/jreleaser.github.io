= Name Templates

Several fields in the JReleaser config file support templating. JReleaser makes use of the
link:https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] format for its templating support. Packagers rely on input files that
also support templates. A template name can be used as `{{name}}`

The following is a list of pre-defined template names:

== Environment

All environment variables are accessible with the `Env.` prefix, for example an environment variable named `JAVA_OPTS`
becomes `{{Env.JAVA_OPTS}}`.

== Build

The following names are related to the current build

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key             | Description
| commitShortHash | head commit hash abbreviated to 7 characters
| commitFullHash  | head commit hash
| timestamp       | current timestamp with RFC3339 format
|===

== Project

The following names are related to xref:configuration:project.adoc[]

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]

| projectName            | the project name
| projectNameCapitalized | the project name, capitalized, hyphens replaced by spaces.
| projectVersion         | the project version
| projectDescription     | the project description

|===

Additionally, every key/value from `project.extraProperties` is mapped with `project` as key prefix and the capitalized
key, such that

[source,yaml]

project:
  extraProperties:
    # Key will be capitalized and prefixed
    # with `project`, i.e, `projectFoo`.

The following names match the first artifact in a distribution

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]

| distributionUrl      | the URL required to download the artifact
| distributionSha256   | the SHA256 checksum of the artifact's file

Thus, for artifacts defined as

[source,yaml]
----
distributions:
  app:

      - path: path/to/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}.zip
      - path: path/to/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-mac.zip
