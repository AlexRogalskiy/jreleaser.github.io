= Changelog

You may define either `content` or `contentTemplate`, with the latter taking precedence over the former.

Changelog formatting applies only to the automatically generated changelog, that is, formatting won't occur if the `external`
property is set. Format applies only to local commits at the moment, the use of labelers is highly encouraged.

The `changelog.format` property only accepts the following name templates:

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key             | Description
| commitShortHash | head commit hash abbreviated to 7 characters
| commitFullHash  | head commit hash
| commitTitle     | first line of the commit message
| commitAuthor    | full name of the commit author
| commitsUrl      | commits URl as provided by the Git host
|===

The `content` and `contentTemplate` accept all xref:configuration:name-templates.adoc[], take special consideration on
`{{changelogChanges}}` and `{{changelogContributors}}` as they define the parsed commits.

== Commits

If you wish to generate the changelog between two tags, with tags in between, you may configure `previousTagName`.
It generates the changelog based on all commits between the two tags. (`git log <previousTagName>...<tagName>`).

If not defined, it will default to the logical previous tag of the defined `tagName`.

== Contributors

Contributor names are added to the formatted changelog by default. You may choose to provide a custom format or disable
this behavior completely. The `contributors.format` property accepts the following templates:

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key                       | Description
| contributorName           | the contributor's name as plain text
| contributorNameAsLink     | the contributor's name as a link
| contributorUsername       | the contributor's username as plain text
| contributorUsernameAsLink | the contributor's username as a link
|===

The use of `{{contributorNameAsLink}}`, `{{contributorUsername}}`, or `{{contributorUsernameAsLink}}` incurs on a
network call to the remote service to find out information related to the given contributor.

NOTE: Use a `-` or `*` character as prefix in `format` to list each contributor on its own row.

The following configuration

== Presets

Presets define conventions applicable to:

 * labelers
 * categories
 * replacers
 * hide
   ** categories
   ** contributors

You may apply a preset while at the same time define additional elements. Your configuration takes precedence over the
preset's, allowing you to add/merge. For the time being you can't remove a setting defined by a preset.

=== Gitmoji

Commit messages that follow the link:https://gitmoji.dev/[Gitmoji] convention will be automatically labeled and
categorized. The following table shows mappings that you may use when this preset is applied:

[%header, cols="<,<,^,<2"]
