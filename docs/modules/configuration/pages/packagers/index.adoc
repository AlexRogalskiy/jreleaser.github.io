= Packagers

After a release is created at the desired remote Git host, JReleaser can generate and publish specialized packagers
into their respective distribution media, such a Git repository you have access to, or a packager store.

The sections defined here can be applied globally (for all distributions) or per distribution. Global configuration is
inherited by distribution configuration. Here's for example how xref:packagers/homebrew.adoc[] and xref:packagers/scoop.adoc[]
can be activated for all distributions:

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros"]
----
packagers:
  brew:
    enabled: true
  scoop:
    enabled: true
----

Given this setup here's how a distribution may inherit that configuration and disable Scoop while keeping Homebrew active:

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros"]
----
packagers:
  brew:
    enabled: true
  scoop:
    enabled: true

distributions:
  app:
    scoop:
      enabled: false
    artifacts:
      - path: path/to/app-1.0.0.zip
