== Skip Release

You have the option to skip artifacts and files from a release using these fields:

 * `files`. Affects files defined by xref:configuration:files.adoc[].
 * `artifacts`. Affects files defined by the `artifacts` section of a xref:configuration:distributions.adoc[Distribution].
 * `checksums`. Affects the calculated checksums for artifacts and files.
 * `signatures`. Affects the generated signature files for artifacts, files, and checksums.

Additionally you may decide to skip artifacts by defining the `skipRelease` extra property as `true`. The associated
signature file may be skipped as well by defining `skipReleaseSignatures` as an extra property on the artifact. You may
also define either of this two properties on the owning `distribution` in which case the settings apply to all artifacts
found in the distribution.
