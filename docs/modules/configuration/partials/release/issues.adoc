== Issues

Upon release, JReleaser may attach a label and post a comment on every matching issue found in the changelog.
The following regular expressions will be used to find matching issues:

 - {{issueTrackerUrl}}/(\d+)
 - {{repoOwner}}/{{repoName}}#(\d+)
 - #(\d+)

The release process applies the following rules to mark issues:

1. Create the target label if it does not exist.
2. Lookup every matching issue. Skip if **not** closed or if it already has the label applied.
3. Apply the label and post a comment.
