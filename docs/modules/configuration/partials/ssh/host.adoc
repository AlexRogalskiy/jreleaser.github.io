== Host

You can have the host set in the configuration as shown above, or you can have it read from an environment variable.
The configured name of the {prefix} server will be used to build the environment variable name.
This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_HOST`. If your instance is named `production`,
you can store the host in the environment variable `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PRODUCTION_HOST`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.

If a configured host is found in the configuration file, then the environment variable is not used at all.

Alternatives to `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_HOST` are (in order):

* `JRELEASER_SSH_NAME_HOST`
* `JRELEASER_{prefix}_HOST`
* `JRELEASER_SSH_HOST`
