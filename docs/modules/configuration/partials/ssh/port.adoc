== Port

You can have the port set in the configuration as shown above, or you can have it read from an environment variable.
The configured name of the {prefix} server will be used to build the environment variable name.
This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_PORT`. If your instance is named `production`,
you can store the port in the environment variable `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PRODUCTION_PORT`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.

If a configured port is found in the configuration file, then the environment variable is not used at all.

Alternatives to `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_PORT` are (in order):

* `JRELEASER_SSH_NAME_PORT`
* `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PORT`
* `JRELEASER_SSH_PORT`
