== Username

You can have the username set in the configuration as shown above, or you can have it read from an environment variable.
The configured name of the {prefix} server will be used to build the environment variable name.
This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_USERNAME`. If your instance is named `production`,
you can store the username in the environment variable `JRELEASER_{prefix}_PRODUCTION_USERNAME`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.

If a configured username is found in the configuration file, then the environment variable is not used at all.

Alternatives to `JRELEASER_{prefix}_NAME_USERNAME` are (in order):

* `JRELEASER_SSH_NAME_USERNAME`
* `JRELEASER_{prefix}_USERNAME`
* `JRELEASER_SSH_USERNAME`
