== Password

The password will be stored in an environment variable. The configured name of the FTP server will
be used. This means that the name per configured instance needs to be unique.

The name of the environment variable will be `JRELEASER_FTP_NAME_PASSWORD`. If your instance is named `production`,
you need to store the secret in the environment variable `JRELEASER_FTP_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD`. The name will be
transformed to uppercase.
