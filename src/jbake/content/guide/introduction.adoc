JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.yml` file if using the <<_jreleaser_cli,CLI>> or
<<_jreleaser_ant,Ant>> options, or direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` (<<_jreleaser_maven,Maven>>) or
`build.gradle` (<<_jreleaser_gradle,Gradle>>) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command.
