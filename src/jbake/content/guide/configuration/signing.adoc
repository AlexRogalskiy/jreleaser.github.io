Signing ensures that the artifacts have been generated by yourself and your users can verify that by comparing the
generated signature with your public signing key.

JReleaser can sign all files, including distribution archives and any extra files attached to the project. This section
must be configured if you intent to sign commits as well.

Use the following options to customize how files may be signed:

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros"]

# [optional]

  # Enables or disables file signing.

  enabled: true

  # Generates an armored signature.
  # Defaults to `true`.
  armored: true

  # The public GPG (ascii armored) used to sign files and commits.
  # If left unspecified, the JRELEASER_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY environment variable must be defined.
  # [required]
  publicKey:

  # The private GPG (ascii armored) used to sign files and commits.
  # If left unspecified, the JRELEASER_GPG_SECRET_KEY environment variable must be defined.
