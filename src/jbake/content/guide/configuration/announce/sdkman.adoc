This announcer has the following considerations:

* No snapshot releases are supported.
* Only `zip` artifacts are supported.
* The default platform is set to `UNIVERSAL` if the artifact did not define a value for its `platform` field.
* If there's more than one artifact then each artifact requires distinct `platform` values, otherwise the latest
 artifact will override any previous matches by platform.
* Announcing will be skipped if no suitable artifacts are found.

Supported platform values are:

* `mac`, `osx`.
* `win`, `windows`.
* `linux`.
